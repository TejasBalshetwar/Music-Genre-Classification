# Music-Genre-Classification
As we all know music is ubiquitous. We listen to music everywhere.
Often we listen to music according to our playlists and most of the time the songs in playlist are grouped by the genre.
So, classifying music according to genre is an important task.
In this project I have used the GTZAN dataset which consists of 1000 songs divided into 10 genres.
I have used the "librosa" library to extract features from the audio files.
Then, to classify the data I have created a deep learning model using CNN.
After training the model for approx. 600 epochs, the model has achieved the testing accuracy of 85%.
